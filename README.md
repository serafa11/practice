#  BOLIVIA IMPORTS 2020-2024

### Project overview
This project compiles and analyzes Bolivia’s import data from 2020 to 2024, aiming to identify trends and patterns in trade activity during this period. Given Bolivia’s ongoing 2025 fuel supply crisis (affecting gasoline 
and diesel), the analysis will prioritize fuels and petroleum-derived products to inform strategic decision-making.

### Motivation
This initiative serves as a hands-on application of recently acquired data analysis skills, leveraging Python and its core libraries to explore, clean, and analyze datasets—culminating in actionable visualizations. While diverse
datasets are available for such exercises, this project intentionally focuses on a highly relevant local context: Bolivia’s ongoing hydrocarbon supply challenges.
